# Milestone: v1.1 (Flutter Redesign & UI/UX Improvements)

## Completed: 2026-02-25

## Deliverables
- ✅ Initialize new Flutter project (`matriculaup_app`)
- ✅ Implement side-by-side search + timetable views
- ✅ Build duplicate prevention and visual conflict warnings
- ✅ Advanced views: Regular (Mon-Sat) vs Exam (Final/Parcial)
- ✅ Windows distribution executable generation script

## Phases Completed
1. Phase 5: Flutter App Initialization & UI Core — 2026-02-25
2. Phase 6: Interactive Schedule & Conflict Prevention — 2026-02-25
3. Phase 7: Advanced Views & Desktop Export — 2026-02-25

## Lessons Learned
- The Provider package works exceptionally well for managing the global schedule state (`ScheduleState`) while keeping UI components reactive.
- `file_picker` effectively handles reading external JSON data on desktop platforms.
- Dart's concise iteration and collection methods make calculating time overlap logic cleaner compared to equivalent Python snippets.
- Creating a separated executable script for Windows builds (`build_flutter_exe.ps1`) ensures reliable compilation without needing to memorize long CLI arguments.
