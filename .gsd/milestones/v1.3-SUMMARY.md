# Milestone v1.3 Summary (Web Deployment & Polish)

## Goal
Automate the deployment of the MatriculaUp Flutter application to the web via GitHub Pages, while fixing cross-platform bugs and edge-cases that appeared during early user validation.

## Status: Complete
**Completed Date:** 2026-02-25

## Features Delivered
*   **Zero-touch Web Deployments**: Configured a `.github/workflows/deploy_web.yml` automated CI/CD pipeline. Every commit pushed to `main` now automatically triggers a compilation of `flutter build web --base-href "/MatriculaUp/"`, deploying the result to the `gh-pages` branch.
*   **Web Compatibility Layer**: 
    *   Replaced the `File()` based loading mechanism inside `DataLoader` with purely in-memory byte buffer streams via `file_picker`'s `withData` property, bypassing Chrome's sandbox limitations.
    *   Injected the `courses_2026-1_v1.json` catalogue directly into the Flutter Web internal Assets memory pool and wired it to auto-load in `home_page.dart`'s `initState`, so Web users don't face a blank sheet upon load.
*   **Conflict Algorithm Overhaul**: Rewrote the overlap detection engine in `ScheduleState.dart` to cleanly separate "Exams" (PARCIAL/FINAL) from "Regular Classes" (CLASE/PRÁCTICA). This effectively resolves false-positive overlaps by simulating the reality that exams occur in completely different weeks than lectures. 

## Key Learnings & Decisions
*   In Flutter Web, never use `dart:io` to read user files from their hard drives. It must exclusively be read as raw bytes or UTF-8 streams using standard Web File API logic.
*   Comparing Enum values (`SessionType.parcial`) against primitive strings (`"PARCIAL"`) will silently fail in Dart without throwing syntax exceptions, making type-safety hygiene critical for edge-case algorithms.

## What's Next?
The application is functionally complete across Web and Windows platforms. Awaiting User's `/new-milestone` directive for potential v1.4 changes or maintenance.
